# Horiseon Homepage (week 1 project)

## Description

A nice homepage for Horiseon. It has a few articles relating to search engine optimization. I built this, edited the existing code, to expand my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS
I learned a lot about semantic elements, and got some practice cleaning up the recursive existing code.

## Installation

If you want to instal this for some reason, nothing special is needed to run it. It's just an HTML, CSS, and some picture assets.

## Usage

You can view the published webpage [here](https://spawze.github.io/week1project/)  

It's pretty simple. You can scroll to view the contents of the webpage, OR you can use the fancy links at the top of the webpage to instantly navigate to that section.
